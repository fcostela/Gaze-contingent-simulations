# Gaze-contingent-simulations
Gaze-contingent simulations of hemianopia, tunnel vision, and central visual loss (macular degeneration)
I had wide experience simulating low vision impairments using gaze-continget display systems. In the repository, I share the scripts I wrote in Matlab to simulate central vision loss (macular degeneration), hemianopia, and tunnel vision. I have used these methodologies in training programs (check section of PRL training) and also developed gaze-prediction methods to optimize the delay between the eye-tracker and the display system (see section Machine Learning - Gaze prediction).
